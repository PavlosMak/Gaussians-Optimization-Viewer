This project aims to demonstrate how the 3D Gaussian Splatting optimization algorithm adapts the Gaussian Kernels to match the underlying scene's appearance and geometry. 

# Running Instructions
After cloning the repository, you can open it in Unity3D (tested and developed with 2022.3.13f1). 

The implementation loads the optimization frames on startup of the program. To do so you will first need to download the optimization frames from [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/10Gm3BeMG1W65ElEN2GFmPrEDkqIWkiaU/view?usp=sharing) and then change the `basePath` variable in **Assets/scripts/GaussianRenderer** to point to optimization. Those frames where generated by the original [3D Gaussian Splatting implementation](https://github.com/graphdeco-inria/gaussian-splatting). 

The controls for the program are:
* WASD and Q-E to move.
* R to reset the camera position
* H to show/hide the kernels
* F to show/hide the floaters
* V to show/hide the floor
* T to toggle the train's transparency
* M to show the example renders UI

# Acknowledgments
For moving the camera I used the [Free Fly Camera](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/camera/free-fly-camera-140739) module. The the train model was created and freely shared by [Blend Swap's Manried](https://www.blendswap.com/blend/27260).
